# Previous Year Papers

This repository contains previous year question papers and assignment PDFs for various courses from IIIT Hyderabad. It includes materials for both core courses and electives. We have included the corresponding semester (like Spring 2026) for each source.

## Overall Repository Structure

If raising a PR, please adhere to this structure and naming scheme.

```text
.
├── core
│   ├── common

│   ├── cxx
│   │   └── <courses>
│   └── ecx
│       └── <courses>
└── electives
    ├── csx
    │   └── <courses>
    ├── ecx
    │   └── <courses>
    ├── humanities
    │   └── <courses>
    ├── math
    │   └── <courses>
    └── science
        └── <courses>

```

For each course the structure is:

```text
.
└───<course name>
    └───<semester>
        └───<resource (*.pdf)>
```

Hope this helps!
